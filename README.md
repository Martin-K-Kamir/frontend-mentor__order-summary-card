![preview of order summary card](./app/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Coded by [me](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Martin-K-Kamir)! üòÅ

Welcome to the repository for this project. Feel free to look around and expore! üòÄ

### Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

### Development

This is my first own react project and first frontend mentor solution. I had one course on react so I decided to practice my new skills. I mainly wanted to focus on JSX, so that is why i chose this simple solution from frontend mentor.

### Notes

I tried to make the card responsive for the smallest mobiles, but I know that the landscape needed to be improved a bit.
